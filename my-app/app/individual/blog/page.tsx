                      A well-known phenomenon in education which says that an average tutored student does better than 98% of the students in a classroom. This problem has been unsolved since the beginning of history, which is why elites have always spent so much on personal tutoring.

                    If there's anything school is great at, it's destroying your desire to learn. Whether intentional or not, we know this: any kind of classroom instruction will always be less efficient than one-on-one tutoring because it caters to the average.

                      The first key to efficient learning is using the best resources. Overweight teachers, like overweight doctors, rely on outdated knowledge from decades ago. They rarely keep up-to-date with the meta, which is why you need to take your education into your own hands.

                      This skill is valuable because when you have a connected art piece in your head, you can guess where new pieces fit, or if they don't fit at all. This is called intuition. People with strong intuition have high prediction accuracy, easily recognize patterns, and are "fast learners."
